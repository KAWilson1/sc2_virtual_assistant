The schema for creating pairings between Timings and Audio Queues is as follows
    min:sec audio_queue (audio_queue2 audio_queue3 ...)
Where
    min is an integer beween 0-9
    ":" separates min and sec
    sec is an integer between 0-59 (always represented in 2 digits)
    audio_queue is the string of the audio queue file with no extension and in snake_case
    Multiple audio_queues can be defined per line, but only one timing is allowed
Examples
    2:00 barracks
    2:30 factory
    2:45 command_center planetary_fortress starport
Example explained
    Two minutes after pressing the start button, the audio queue "barracks.mp3" will play
    30 seconds after that, "factory.mp3" will play
    15 seconds after that, "command_center.mp3", "planetary_fortress.mp3" and "starport.mp3" will play in sequence
